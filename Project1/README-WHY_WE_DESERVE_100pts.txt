For our project we implemented the Triangle Peg Game.
We think we deserve the full 100 points for our project for the following reasons:

	-We worked over 20 hours putting together Javascript, HTML and CSS (and CSS3) in order to make it good
	-Our Javascript code is efficient, fast, and also consisten in terms of results.
	-We have included CSS3 elements, mainly the following:
		-CSS3 Backgrounds - in the background image
		-CSS3 Animations - in the title
		-CSS3 Text Shadow - in the Help Box at the bottom of the page
	-We have laid out our page so as to be visually appealing, including appropriate colors, text size and affects.
	-We have included a help box for how to play the game, which is useful.
	-We have validated our HTML and made it 100% HTML5 valid.

Thanks for reading this and hopefully this convinced you.
